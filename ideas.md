  <core_principles>
    1. **Radical Clarity**: Information density is managed through progressive disclosure.
    2. **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with a single strong accent color for actions.
    3. **Systematic Typography**: Heavy use of monospaced fonts for data entry combined with a geometric sans-serif for labels.
    4. **Grid Precision**: Layouts adhere strictly to a visible or felt grid, emphasizing order and structure.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Official Ink"**: A palette dominated by white (#ffffff), off-white (#f8f9fa), and deep ink black (#1a1a1a). The accent is a striking "Stamp Blue" (#0056b3) representing the official seal. This conveys authority, precision, and the elimination of ambiguity.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Split-Screen Functionalism**: The screen is divided. The left side contains the form steps in a clear, vertical timeline. The right side shows a live preview of the document being generated, updating in real-time. This connects the digital input directly to the physical output.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Thick Dividers**: Heavy black lines separating sections, reminiscent of printed forms.
    2. **Monospace Data**: User input is displayed in a monospaced font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono) to distinguish it from static labels.
    3. **Status Indicators**: Clear, badge-like indicators for "Draft", "Complete", "Ready to Print".
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Fill and Verify"**: Interactions are crisp and immediate. Focus states are high-contrast outlines. Validation is instant but non-intrusive.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Mechanical Precision**: Transitions are fast (150ms) and linear. No bounces or springs. Elements slide into place with a satisfying "click" feel.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: Inter (Bold, Uppercase, Tracking-wide)
    **Body**: Inter (Regular)
    **Input/Data**: JetBrains Mono (Regular)

  <design_movement>Judicial Serenity</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Calm Authority**: The interface should reduce the stress of administrative tasks.
    2. **Soft Hierarchy**: Depth and layering are used to guide the eye, rather than harsh lines.
    3. **Fluid Guidance**: The form feels like a conversation or a guided process, not a test.
    4. **Trustworthy Aesthetics**: Professional, polished, and stable.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Aegean Institutional"**: A palette of slate blues, cool greys, and warm whites.
    - Primary: Deep Slate Blue (#334155)
    - Background: Cool Grey Mist (#f1f5f9)
    - Surface: Pure White (#ffffff)
    - Accent: Muted Gold (#d97706) for key actions (referencing the scales of justice).
    This palette evokes stability, trust, and the Greek institutional context without being aggressive.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Centered Card Stack**: The form is presented as a series of "cards" in a central column, floating above a subtle, abstract background pattern (perhaps a very faint Greek key or scales motif). This focuses attention entirely on the current task.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Soft Shadows**: Deep, diffuse shadows (box-shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)) to lift the active form area.
    2. **Rounded Corners**: Generous border-radius (0.75rem or 1rem) to soften the bureaucratic feel.
    3. **Subtle Gradients**: Very slight gradients on buttons and headers to add polish.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Gentle Progression"**: As the user completes a field, the next one highlights. Smooth scrolling between sections.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Fluid Ease**: Transitions are smooth (300ms-400ms) with ease-out curves. Cards float up slightly when active.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: Merriweather (Serif, for a touch of tradition and authority)
    **Body**: Lato (Sans-serif, friendly and legible)
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Digital Paperwork (Glassmorphism)</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Transparency & Light**: Using glassmorphism to create a modern, airy feel.
    2. **Contextual Awareness**: The background adapts subtly to the section of the form.
    3. **Visual Metaphor**: Elements that subtly remind of paper (stacks, folds) but rendered in glass.
    4. **Vibrant Professionalism**: Using light and color to make the task less boring.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Lucid Sky"**:
    - Background: A blurred, abstract gradient of soft blue and violet.
    - Cards: Translucent white with backdrop-blur.
    - Text: Dark Navy (#0f172a) for readability.
    - Borders: Semi-transparent white borders to catch the "light".
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Dashboard Canvas**: A wide layout where the form is a floating glass panel on the left, and helpful tips/preview are on floating panels on the right.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Frosted Glass**: Backdrop-filter: blur(12px) on all containers.
    2. **Noise Texture**: A subtle grain overlay to add tactility.
    3. **Floating Action Buttons**: Primary actions float above the content.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Touch & Glow"**: Elements glow faintly when focused.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Ethereal Drift**: Slow, floating animations for background elements. Content fades in and scales up.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: Raleway (Elegant, thin weights)
    **Body**: Quicksand (Rounded, friendly)
  </typography_system>
